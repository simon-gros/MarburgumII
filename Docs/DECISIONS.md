# Architecture decision log

## ADR-001 — Clean Unreal-native restart (accepted 2026-11-08)

Magna Raedarum: Marburgum II is created as a fresh source project. Previous Marburgum work supplies design requirements and may supply reviewed reusable data, but no previous code or assets are assumed to be present. Unreal C++ owns runtime gameplay.

## ADR-002 — Pin Unreal Engine 5.8.3 (accepted 2026-11-08)

The project uses **Unreal Engine 5.8.3**, not a generic `UE5` requirement. `.unreal-engine-version` pins the patch; local checks inspect `Engine/Build/Build.version`. Project engine association can remain `5.8` because that is a launcher-style association, not an exact patch guarantee. Any patch or minor upgrade requires an explicit acceptance decision and native re-build.

## ADR-003 — C# and Rust separation (accepted 2026-11-08)

C# runs Unreal's build rules and independently developed .NET toolchain tasks. Rust provides independent, testable native primitives via a versioned C ABI. Neither is prematurely integrated as a gameplay scripting language inside Unreal.

## ADR-004 — Preserve systems and skills, reject talents (accepted 2026-11-08)

The game's design centers on a persistent fictionalized 1990s Maribor with skills, missions, jobs, vehicles, economic/social systems and a solo-friendly experience. The previous automatically generated talent subsystem is intentionally excluded.

## ADR-005 — MMORPG-first authority and module boundaries (accepted 2026-11-08)

The title is a server-authoritative **MMORPG from initial architecture**, with solo-friendly and small-group play occurring under the same world/authority rules. The original project's Client/Shared/Server module separation is retained conceptually in a fresh implementation: `MarburgumIIClient` (ClientOnly), `MarburgumIIShared` (Runtime) and `MarburgumIIServer` (ServerOnly). The dedicated-server runtime and client/network acceptance are Stage **0** requirements, not Stage 4 optional work. Shared definitions are engine-independent wherever possible, and the new runtime initially uses Unreal-native replication rather than assuming compatibility with the original TCP protocol v3. Gameplay and narrative systems from the original remain the majority of the planned game, but their implementation is rebuilt and verified incrementally.

## ADR-006 — Early showcase-quality UI; exclude wanted stars and police chases (accepted 2026-11-08)

The original Marburgum's **semantic UI components** (transient location banner, contextual interaction prompt, one pinned mission objective, condition/progression feedback, client connection states and Character/Skills/Inventory/Journal panels) are retained, but their appearance is rebuilt as a polished, responsive, high-quality graphical Unreal **5.8.3** client interface from the first development milestones. This is prioritized alongside Stage 0B networking and required for Stage 1 public-showcase gameplay acceptance, **before** wide-map or gameplay feature proliferation. GUI assets and UI design remain wholly client-side, while substantive values originate from authoritative replicated state. The original **wanted stars, wanted level/heat, police pursuit, police chase, chase HUD and associated escalation mechanics are explicitly excluded** from MarburgumII; they are not migration parity obligations. This exclusion does not by itself ban police/institution NPCs in authored stories. The old generated Talent UI also remains excluded. See [UI_HUD_DESIGN.md](UI_HUD_DESIGN.md).

## ADR-007 — Semantic modular UI and HUD with staged customization (accepted 2026-11-08)

Adopt [UI_HUD_ONTOLOGY.md](UI_HUD_ONTOLOGY.md) and the companion versioned [UI/HUD vocabulary](../Data/Ontology/ui_hud.v0.1.json) as the semantic baseline for the UE **5.8.3** client presentation. The interface is modular, low-clutter, activity-aware, accessible and event-driven; every module has an explicit authority/privacy provenance, visibility policy and layout slot. Build a coherent premium default through UI-01–04 in parallel with NET-001, then add UI-05 contextual activity/party modes as real systems arrive and UI-06 movable/resizable saved layout profiles only after the default is visually accepted. The online truth comes exclusively from authoritative replication and receipts, while local UI settings and labeled fixtures remain client-only. The original location/action/objective/condition/skills/inventory/journal semantics are retained. No police pursuit/wanted UI or generated Talents are reintroduced. The [UI_HUD_ROADMAP.md](UI_HUD_ROADMAP.md) specifies acceptance gates and public showcase evidence.

## ADR-008 — Personal owner playtest required for all major playable features (accepted 2026-11-08)

Every major player-facing feature must be **specified, implemented, tested, personally played by the project owner and explicitly approved** before it can be described as "accepted", "finished" or "feature complete". Green CI, successful native build, agent-generated videos, documentation and simulated playtest outputs cannot substitute for the owner's in-game evaluation. Acceptance must identify an exact build SHA, engine patch, features/scenarios, expected/observed behaviors and the explicit owner decision (`approved`, `changes_requested`, `rejected`). Without such a record, a feature remains `implemented_awaiting_owner_playtest` or `awaiting_owner_approval`. Rework or material changes reopen the gate. This rule covers combat, movement, MMO connection, missions, UI/HUD, skills, economy, fishing, vehicles, ecology, environmental rendering and any large imported city map.

## ADR-009 — Purchased Maribor city model as planned default geometry (accepted direction 2026-11-08)

The planned **primary base geometry** for MarburgumII is [TurboSquid product 1639711](https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-city-area-building-model/1639711), a licensed 3D model depicting Maribor, **subject to future purchase, asset/license verification, historical alignment, UE 5.8.3 runtime validation and the owner's explicit personal acceptance**. The original Marburgum generated map is **no longer the default import path**, but remains reference and fallback; original authored geography, mission/interaction identities, 1990s research, vegetation and fish data continue to inform the new city. Do not assume the seller's 2022 GIS model reflects the 1990s, is low cost at runtime, contains native C4D-only features in FBX, or can be redistributed in public source control. Local proprietary files are protected from Git commits. Stage 0B networking uses its own minimal world; Stage 1 should use a licensed and approved Lent/Drava slice when available, with city expansion after a representative acceptance test. See [WORLD_MAP_ADOPTION.md](WORLD_MAP_ADOPTION.md).

## Open decisions

- Public license and rules for distributing source/art; no license has been selected.
- Minimum shipping platforms and tested build matrix.
- Production persistence engine, migrations, account/session admission, login security and service topology; initial Unreal-native replication is accepted for the first vertical slice.
- Rust static-library integration across Windows/Linux and ABI test approach.
- Geospatial/historical data provenance and acceptable licensing.
